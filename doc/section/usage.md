# Usage

> Example using mocha as the testing framework

This example is part of the knex mocha [tests](./index.mocha.spec.js). They
can be run using using the following npm script.

```bash
require ./doc/script/mocha-tests.sh
```

```js
require ./index.mocha.spec.js
```

You can consider using `async / await` syntax as the knex helper returns
a promise.

```bash
require  ./doc/script/async-tests.sh
```

```js
require ./index.async.spec.js
```
